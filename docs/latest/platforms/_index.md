  Ondat specific notes for supported platforms.

While Ondat is platform agnostic, there are certain configurations
or operations that relate to a specific platform.

Ondat can be used in any Kubernetes distribution when the
[prerequisites]({{< ref "docs/prerequisites/_index.md" >}}) are met. That
includes Kubernetes managed services.
