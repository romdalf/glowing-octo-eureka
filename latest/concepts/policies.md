# Policies

Ondat policies are a way to control user and group access to Ondat
[Namespaces](../concepts/namespaces.md). To grant a user or group
access to a namespace, a policy needs to be created mapping the user or group
to the namespace. 

>Note: Users always have access to the default namespace

For more information on how to use policies, see the 
[Policies operations](../operations/policies.md) page.
